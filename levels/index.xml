      <description> Sometimes we need to delete files, not only add them. But in git deleting a file means add-ing the deletion to the staging area and committing that change.
🧩 Hints Click on hints to reveal them.
Useful commands for this level git rm, git status, git commit. Nudge me in the right direction? StackOverflow link. </description>

      <description>We can also add and delete directories from git, not only files. This level about that.
🧩 Hints Click on hints to reveal them.
Creating directories? To create a directory, run mkdir. Adding directories? You can add all files in a directory using git add some/directory/*, or just git add some/directory.
Be careful to not add all files if you don&amp;rsquo;t actually want all of them!</description>

      <description>For this stage, you must run the script ./setup_hooks_stage.sh first!
You need to add more than 100 files into the add_files_here directory, and you can&amp;rsquo;t do it in more than 3 commits. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard, should it?
Once you&amp;rsquo;ve solved this stage, be sure to undo what setup_hooks_stage.sh does 😊

      <description>The flag is in the commit message of this branch&amp;rsquo;s grandparent.
🧩 Hints Click on the hint to see it.
Grandparent? I mean &amp;ldquo;two commits before this branch&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a script called runme.py. Try to run it.
Once you&amp;rsquo;re done with this level, remember to push!
🧩 Hints Click on hints to reveal them.
How do I run it? ./runme.py
See why in this AskUbuntu thread.
I ran it, now what? Well, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, and raised an exception. What does the error say? I got not something we can merge (⊙_⊙;) Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re trying to merge something with the correct name - remember that there are remote branches and local branches, and they are different.</description>

I tried to merge but got an error I know, that&amp;rsquo;s the point :) Which one is correct? This time, both sides are missing some parts. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to manually combine them. Useful commands for this level git merge, git mergetool, git checkout, git status.</description>

      <description>runme.py is a silly name&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll call the script ./should_rename_this.py for now, and I&amp;rsquo;ll rename in another branch. Also, the script needs to print another thing&amp;hellip;
This time the conflict is quite difficuly to solve, as the problem isn&amp;rsquo;t only content, it&amp;rsquo;s also structure (tree). You can solve it!
🧩 Hints Click on the hint to see it.
Tree? 🌳 The conflict is caused because both branches renamed the same file - changed the directory tree.</description>

      <description>This level was a part of OWASP CTF 2020.
The focus of this level is AppSec, and specifically, git security. But not git fundamentals, like the rest of the levels in this CTF. So you should probably solve the rest of the levels first.

      <description>This level is a little harder. Don&amp;rsquo;t panic!
In this level, we have a base branch and a topic branch.
The base branch is parallelizing-barnhardtite-base and the topic branch is parallelizing-barnhardtite-topic Notice the difference: ^^^^^ The base branch introduced a script called runme.py, which prints all the resources in the runme_resources/ folder.
Try to run it now.
In the topic branch, we will need to add specific resources. To do this, run the add_resources.</description>

      <description>In this level, the commits are all out of order. Reorder them using an interactive rebase, and push them in the correct order.
In case you&amp;rsquo;ve never watch the classic sketch &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s on First?&amp;rdquo;, The correct order is:
First base: Who
Second base: What
Third base: I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know
(By the way, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, you should. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic.)
