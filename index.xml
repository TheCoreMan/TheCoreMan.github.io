      <title>2021Q2: Professional Self Reflection</title>

      <description>Every Quarter, I try to spend some time on professional self-reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the journey of being aware of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, and getting better all the time.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog about it, instead of just putting it in a notebook. Why?
 One of the things I want to do is communicate my professional profile better to other people, so this is a way to do that.</description>

      <description>Want your blog to include Math Expressions, like the Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula?
$$ E=mc^2 $$
Or L&amp;rsquo;H√¥pital&amp;rsquo;s rule?
$$ \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f\left( x \right)}}{{g\left( x \right)}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}}{{g&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}} $$
Or Matrix Multiplication?
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$</description>

 Continuing on the journey of knowledge, I wanted to practice more Clojure. Last time we went over first sections of Learn Clojure: syntax and functions. The main way I learned was by doing the exercises at the bottom of each page. But for the rest of the subjects in the guide, there are no exercises!</description>

      <description>I started this post AFTER starting to work on a Clojure script, when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable enough with the language and tools to actually start working on the script. I needed to feel more comfortable before starting to work.
In this post I go over how to setup a basic Clojure development environment and I solve all the exercises from the &amp;ldquo;Learn Clojure&amp;rdquo; guide, with examples and explanations.</description>

      <description>Adding EmacsLips programs to extend Emacs&amp;rsquo;s functionality from source is something I&amp;rsquo;ve found non-obvious (had to open multiple tabs for). Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to figure it out, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually very simple, so here&amp;rsquo;s the guide:
A - Find the program you want to add In my case, it was &amp;ldquo;Transpose Frame&amp;rdquo; by irie.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled across it from this StackExchange answer.
 If the program is available on MELPA, you can just add it to the additional-packages list in your .</description>

Also, this is an old blogpost about something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually released as part of the project yet. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll finish it but the documentation value is important.

      <description>I recently gave a talk in DefCon SAFEMODE Red Team Village. It was a very interesting and unique experience, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
The talk itself The talk was titled Making Breach &amp;amp; Attack Simulation Accessible and Actionable with Infection Monkey. Watch the recording here:
  Lectures, COVID, and crowd interaction Giving a live talk is something I very much enjoy doing. üé§
Crowd interaction, controlling my voice, gesturing, joking with the audience now and then, answering questions; Honestly, I really like it.</description>

‚Äï Karle Wilson Baker
 Welcome back to my devlog series, where I discuss the development of make-git-better version 2 - a git CTF challenge. Last time we finished developing a script that automated generating the main git server hook for the CTF.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re automating another big part of the challenge: creating the level browser.
 Why do we need a level browser?</description>
