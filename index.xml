      <description>&amp;ldquo;Shay, you mentioned some number of episodes ago that the army took your mouse for a while. What would you do if they took your keyboard, as well?&amp;rdquo;
This post is starting out by me typing it on my keyboard. However, if things go well, by the end of this post I should be typing it with my voice.
How did we get here? On a recent Cup o&amp;rsquo; Go episode I interviewed Josh Bleecher Snyder, and he mentioned that he was using Cursorless to edit his code, since he was dealing with some wrist pain.</description>

      <title>Learning CSS #2: CSS Diner Writeup üç±ü•¢</title>
      <link>https://www.mrnice.dev/posts/learning-css-with-css-battles-2/</link>

      <description>Met up with Aviv Sarig to practice some CSS. I found CSS Diner and we went through it to hone our CSS selection skills.
Start with &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;: why practice selectors? I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why we need selectors in the first place. The answer is simple - to select specific elements in the DOM so we can style them the way we want.
I think that building good semantic HTML is the first step to writing good CSS, and that knowing how I&amp;rsquo;ll end up selecting elements will impact how I structure the HTML itself.</description>

      <description>Recently Google let me see the new Analytics dashboard (they moved from&amp;hellip; Something something analytics to something something Analytics 4). And one of they things I saw was that my blog&amp;rsquo;s performance was bad!
In general the blog&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure didn&amp;rsquo;t get much love since I opened it a few years ago, so a cleanup for performance and content is probably in order.
Get initial Lighthouse results What&amp;rsquo;s Lighthouse? It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that Google provides to measure the performance of your site.</description>

      <description>My experience working alongside ChatGPT to generate OpenAPI specs.
As part of a client job (as a newly-minted freelancer!) I got, I needed to design an API. I decided to write an OpenAPI spec. I&amp;rsquo;m so used to gRPC that looking at the OpenAPI JSONs and YAMLs doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;gel&amp;rdquo; well in my brain, but I do know the basics of API design. And, well&amp;hellip;
With that in mind, and since the project itself revolves around LLMs, I decided to write the spec together with ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Book report: Turn the Ship Around! A VP R&amp;D&#39;s Summary</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet following Anton Drukh&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.
This summary is mostly for me and for people I&amp;rsquo;ll refer it to - so it&amp;rsquo;s not the most friendly read. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the book, this post can serve as a useful TL;DR for you. I highly recommend you do read it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great read and a short one, too!</description>

      <description>You might be asking yourself how did you get here? I know I&amp;rsquo;m sort of asking myself the same question: the TL;DR is I never stop learning, and right now I needed to learn some CSS for my job.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning CSS for real at work recently to be able to do full-stack E2E development. So far, CSS was a &amp;ldquo;hack it until it works&amp;rdquo; kind of thing for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it properly.</description>

      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>I recently set up Backstage.io on our cluster. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t super-easy, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;go deep&amp;rdquo; and tried to make this a learning opportiunity.
I&amp;rsquo;m also definitely not a DevOps expert, so I had to learn some stuff myself along the way. Here&amp;rsquo;s my best approximation at a useful guide for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s going to walk the same path! Hopefully I can save you some time.

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>
