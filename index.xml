      <description>Recently Google let me see the new Analytics dashboard (they moved from&amp;hellip; Something something analytics to something something Analytics 4). And one of they things I saw was that my blog&amp;rsquo;s performance was bad!
In general the blog&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure didn&amp;rsquo;t get much love since I opened it a few years ago, so a cleanup for performance and content is probably in order.
Get initial Lighthouse results What&amp;rsquo;s Lighthouse? It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that Google provides to measure the performance of your site.</description>

      <description>My experience working alongside ChatGPT to generate OpenAPI specs.
As part of a client job (as a newly-minted freelancer!) I got, I needed to design an API. I decided to write an OpenAPI spec. I&amp;rsquo;m so used to gRPC that looking at the OpenAPI JSONs and YAMLs doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;gel&amp;rdquo; well in my brain, but I do know the basics of API design. And, well&amp;hellip;
With that in mind, and since the project itself revolves around LLMs, I decided to write the spec together with ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Book report: Turn the Ship Around! A VP R&amp;D&#39;s Summary</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet following Anton Drukh&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.
This summary is mostly for me and for people I&amp;rsquo;ll refer it to - so it&amp;rsquo;s not the most friendly read. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the book, this post can serve as a useful TL;DR for you. I highly recommend you do read it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great read and a short one, too!</description>

      <description>You might be asking yourself how did you get here? I know I&amp;rsquo;m sort of asking myself the same question: the TL;DR is I never stop learning, and right now I needed to learn some CSS for my job.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning CSS for real at work recently to be able to do full-stack E2E development. So far, CSS was a &amp;ldquo;hack it until it works&amp;rdquo; kind of thing for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it properly.</description>

      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>I recently set up Backstage.io on our cluster. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t super-easy, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;go deep&amp;rdquo; and tried to make this a learning opportiunity.
I&amp;rsquo;m also definitely not a DevOps expert, so I had to learn some stuff myself along the way. Here&amp;rsquo;s my best approximation at a useful guide for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s going to walk the same path! Hopefully I can save you some time.

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>

      <description>Part three of the joint project with my incredibly sharp wife, Olga!
This post is a part of a series, so [check out the entire series for context] (https://www.mrnice.dev/tags/slack/).
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into how we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a Database in our application. The post starts with the design, then moves to implementation of DB connectivity, then the data models themselves, and finally some testing.
Upfront, we had to decide if we&amp;rsquo;ll choose a relational database or something else - and we decided to go relational.</description>

This post is a part of a series, so [check out part 1 for context] (../building-a-slack-bot-with-python-on-gcp).
Warning: As our development of this project was a little &amp;ldquo;all over the place&amp;rdquo; as we try to fit it to our busy lives and the Holiday Season, the blog post is a little all over the place as well.
