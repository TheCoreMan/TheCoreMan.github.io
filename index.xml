      <title>CSS Battle #1 Writeup: Learning CSS</title>

      <description>You might be asking yourself how did you get here? I know I&amp;rsquo;m sort of asking myself the same question: the TL;DR is I never stop learning, and right now I needed to learn some CSS for my job.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning CSS for real at work recently to be able to do full-stack E2E development. So far, CSS was a &amp;ldquo;hack it until it works&amp;rdquo; kind of thing for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it properly.</description>

      <title>How to Build Your Team to Increase Velocity</title>

      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>I recently set up Backstage.io on our cluster. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t super-easy, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;go deep&amp;rdquo; and tried to make this a learning opportiunity.
I&amp;rsquo;m also definitely not a DevOps expert, so I had to learn some stuff myself along the way. Here&amp;rsquo;s my best approximation at a useful guide for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s going to walk the same path! Hopefully I can save you some time.

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>

      <description>Part three of the joint project with my incredibly sharp wife, Olga!
This post is a part of a series, so [check out the entire series for context] (https://www.mrnice.dev/tags/slack/).
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into how we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a Database in our application. The post starts with the design, then moves to implementation of DB connectivity, then the data models themselves, and finally some testing.
Upfront, we had to decide if we&amp;rsquo;ll choose a relational database or something else - and we decided to go relational.</description>

This post is a part of a series, so [check out part 1 for context] (../building-a-slack-bot-with-python-on-gcp).
Warning: As our development of this project was a little &amp;ldquo;all over the place&amp;rdquo; as we try to fit it to our busy lives and the Holiday Season, the blog post is a little all over the place as well.
QoL improvements Slimming down the Docker Image size Adding a test endpoint to the server, to make sure it works Adding basic CI Setting up a local development environment Designing and Building the Bot&amp;rsquo;s Business Logic Let&amp;rsquo;s do some Product - designing the user flows Initial development - design, mocks, stubs Let&amp;rsquo;s do some Development - using Bolt Let&amp;rsquo;s get sidetracked - Web servers, web applications, and WSGI Next up QoL improvements Before moving on the the next big tasks, we wanted to do some small QoL improvements, which we introduced in 3 separate PRs.</description>

      <description>Every Quarter, I try to spend some time on professional self-reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the journey of being aware of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, and getting better all the time.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog about it, instead of just putting it in a notebook. Why?
One of the things I want to do is communicate my professional profile better to other people, so this is a way to do that.</description>

      <description>Want your blog to include Math Expressions, like the Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula?
$$ E=mc^2 $$
Or L&amp;rsquo;H√¥pital&amp;rsquo;s rule?
$$ \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f\left( x \right)}}{{g\left( x \right)}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}}{{g&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}} $$
Or Matrix Multiplication?
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$</description>

Continuing on the journey of knowledge, I wanted to practice more Clojure. Last time we went over first sections of Learn Clojure: syntax and functions. The main way I learned was by doing the exercises at the bottom of each page. But for the rest of the subjects in the guide, there are no exercises!</description>

      <description>I started this post AFTER starting to work on a Clojure script, when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable enough with the language and tools to actually start working on the script. I needed to feel more comfortable before starting to work.
In this post I go over how to setup a basic Clojure development environment and I solve all the exercises from the &amp;ldquo;Learn Clojure&amp;rdquo; guide, with examples and explanations.</description>
