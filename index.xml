      <title>Adding shorts to the blog</title>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m sick. Strep. Missed the Seder, as well.&#xA;Taking a few days off to recover, time to play around with the blog.&#xA;Why add shorts if you already have posts? Shorts are more than a tweet, less than a post.&#xA;Stream of consciousness notes that don&amp;rsquo;t merit a more dedicated write-up.&#xA;Inspired by Brandur Leach&amp;rsquo;s fragments in his beautiful corner of the web.&#xA;My hope is that this short-form, more than a tweet, less than a post format will help me publish more often.</description>

      <description>So, one early morning, and I‚Äôm just getting my coffee. For fun, let‚Äôs automate connecting to bluetooth AirPods without touching the mouse. Quick Google brings up blueutil, and a tiny bit of jq was all the glue needed:&#xA;brew install blueutil blueutil --connect $(blueutil --paired --format json-pretty | jq -r &amp;#34;.[] | select(.name | contains(\&amp;#34;Shay‚Äôs AirPods Pro\&amp;#34;)) | .address) The first time you run this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to give the terminal permission to get access to bluetooth:</description>

      <description>How did we get here Back when I left Reco, my parting gift to everyone at the company was books üìö. At the time, these were books I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, but were recommended by the interwebz. The idea was to stay in touch with the team by gifting them good books and loaning them from time to time. That&amp;rsquo;s how I wrote a book report about &amp;ldquo;Turn the Ship Around&amp;rdquo;, for example.</description>

      <description>To keep this spoiler-free, I&amp;rsquo;ll be redacting the flag. Whenever you see {{ .flag }} in the text, it means that I&amp;rsquo;ve redacted the flag.&#xA;Yes, this is go&amp;rsquo;s text/template syntax. It&amp;rsquo;s the best templating language on the planet.&#xA;Getting started The signup/login UX leaves something to be desired. You start off on the advent page, then sign up, and after the initial signup you are not redirected to the advent.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Shay, you mentioned some number of episodes ago that the army took your mouse for a while. What would you do if they took your keyboard, as well?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This post is starting out by me typing it on my keyboard. However, if things go well, by the end of this post some part should be typed out with my voice.&#xA;Every part that is in between lines (like this one) is actually typed out with Cursorless and with my voice, not my keyboard.</description>

      <title>Learning CSS #2: CSS Diner Writeup üç±ü•¢</title>

      <description>Met up with Aviv Sarig to practice some CSS. I found CSS Diner and we went through it to hone our CSS selection skills.&#xA;Start with &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;: why practice selectors? I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why we need selectors in the first place. The answer is simple - to select specific elements in the DOM so we can style them the way we want.&#xA;I think that building good semantic HTML is the first step to writing good CSS, and that knowing how I&amp;rsquo;ll end up selecting elements will impact how I structure the HTML itself.</description>

      <description>Recently Google let me see the new Analytics dashboard (they moved from&amp;hellip; Something something analytics to something something Analytics 4). And one of they things I saw was that my blog&amp;rsquo;s performance was bad!&#xA;In general the blog&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure didn&amp;rsquo;t get much love since I opened it a few years ago, so a cleanup for performance and content is probably in order.&#xA;Get initial Lighthouse results What&amp;rsquo;s Lighthouse? It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that Google provides to measure the performance of your site.</description>

      <description>My experience working alongside ChatGPT to generate OpenAPI specs.&#xA;As part of a client job (as a newly-minted freelancer!) I got, I needed to design an API. I decided to write an OpenAPI spec. I&amp;rsquo;m so used to gRPC that looking at the OpenAPI JSONs and YAMLs doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;gel&amp;rdquo; well in my brain, but I do know the basics of API design. And, well&amp;hellip;&#xA;With that in mind, and since the project itself revolves around LLMs, I decided to write the spec together with ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Book report: Turn the Ship Around! A VP R&amp;D&#39;s Summary</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet following Anton Drukh&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.&#xA;This summary is mostly for me and for people I&amp;rsquo;ll refer it to - so it&amp;rsquo;s not the most friendly read. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the book, this post can serve as a useful TL;DR for you. I highly recommend you do read it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great read and a short one, too!</description>

      <description>You might be asking yourself how did you get here? I know I&amp;rsquo;m sort of asking myself the same question: the TL;DR is I never stop learning, and right now I needed to learn some CSS for my job.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning CSS for real at work recently to be able to do full-stack E2E development. So far, CSS was a &amp;ldquo;hack it until it works&amp;rdquo; kind of thing for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it properly.</description>
