      <description>Part three of the joint project with my incredibly sharp wife, Olga!
This post is a part of a series, so [check out the entire series for context] (https://www.mrnice.dev/tags/slack/).
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into how we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a Database in our application. The post starts with the design, then moves to implementation of DB connectivity, then the data models themselves, and finally some testing.
Upfront, we had to decide if we&amp;rsquo;ll choose a relational database or something else - and we decided to go relational.</description>

This post is a part of a series, so [check out part 1 for context] (../building-a-slack-bot-with-python-on-gcp).
Warning: As our development of this project was a little &amp;ldquo;all over the place&amp;rdquo; as we try to fit it to our busy lives and the Holiday Season, the blog post is a little all over the place as well.
QoL improvements Slimming down the Docker Image size Adding a test endpoint to the server, to make sure it works Adding basic CI Setting up a local development environment Designing and Building the Bot&amp;rsquo;s Business Logic Let&amp;rsquo;s do some Product - designing the user flows Initial development - design, mocks, stubs Let&amp;rsquo;s do some Development - using Bolt Let&amp;rsquo;s get sidetracked - Web servers, web applications, and WSGI Next up QoL improvements Before moving on the the next big tasks, we wanted to do some small QoL improvements, which we introduced in 3 separate PRs.</description>

      <description>Every Quarter, I try to spend some time on professional self-reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the journey of being aware of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, and getting better all the time.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog about it, instead of just putting it in a notebook. Why?
One of the things I want to do is communicate my professional profile better to other people, so this is a way to do that.</description>

      <description>Want your blog to include Math Expressions, like the Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula?
$$ E=mc^2 $$
Or L&amp;rsquo;H√¥pital&amp;rsquo;s rule?
$$ \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f\left( x \right)}}{{g\left( x \right)}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to c} \frac{{f&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}}{{g&amp;rsquo;\left( x \right)}} $$
Or Matrix Multiplication?
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$</description>

Continuing on the journey of knowledge, I wanted to practice more Clojure. Last time we went over first sections of Learn Clojure: syntax and functions. The main way I learned was by doing the exercises at the bottom of each page. But for the rest of the subjects in the guide, there are no exercises!</description>

      <description>I started this post AFTER starting to work on a Clojure script, when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable enough with the language and tools to actually start working on the script. I needed to feel more comfortable before starting to work.
In this post I go over how to setup a basic Clojure development environment and I solve all the exercises from the &amp;ldquo;Learn Clojure&amp;rdquo; guide, with examples and explanations.</description>

      <description>Adding EmacsLips programs to extend Emacs&amp;rsquo;s functionality from source is something I&amp;rsquo;ve found non-obvious (had to open multiple tabs for). Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to figure it out, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually very simple, so here&amp;rsquo;s the guide:
A - Find the program you want to add In my case, it was &amp;ldquo;Transpose Frame&amp;rdquo; by irie.
I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled across it from this StackExchange answer.
If the program is available on MELPA, you can just add it to the additional-packages list in your .</description>

Also, this is an old blogpost about something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually released as part of the project yet. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll finish it but the documentation value is important.
After another successful workshop,
I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to tackle issue #26 from the project&amp;rsquo;s backlog using rust, Yew, and WebAssembly.</description>

The talk itself The talk was titled Making Breach &amp;amp; Attack Simulation Accessible and Actionable with Infection Monkey. Watch the recording here:
Lectures, COVID, and crowd interaction Giving a live talk is something I very much enjoy doing. üé§
Crowd interaction, controlling my voice, gesturing, joking with the audience now and then, answering questions; Honestly, I really like it.</description>

Welcome back to my devlog series, where I discuss the development of make-git-better version 2 - a git CTF challenge. Last time we finished developing a script that automated generating the main git server hook for the CTF.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re automating another big part of the challenge: creating the level browser.
Why do we need a level browser?</description>
