      <description>How did we get here Back when I left Reco, my parting gift to everyone at the company was books ðŸ“š. At the time, these were books I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, but were recommended by the interwebz.

That&amp;rsquo;s how I wrote a book report about &amp;ldquo;Turn the Ship Around&amp;rdquo;, for example.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a flashcard? Click here! It&amp;rsquo;s a card with a question on one side and the answer on the other. You can use it to study for a test or memorize notes from a book you&amp;rsquo;ve read. Cool! How do I get it for my Hugo site? Download these three files:&#xA;CSS JS HTML Shortcode And put them in the right places in your Hugo project. The JS and CSS files go in your static/js/flashcard.</description>
