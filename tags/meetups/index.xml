      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>
