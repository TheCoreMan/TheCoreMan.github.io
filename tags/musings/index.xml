      <title>How to Build Your Team to Increase Velocity</title>

      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)&#xA;After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>

      <title>2021Q2: Professional Self Reflection</title>

      <description>Every Quarter, I try to spend some time on professional self-reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the journey of being aware of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, and getting better all the time.&#xA;This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog about it, instead of just putting it in a notebook. Why?&#xA;One of the things I want to do is communicate my professional profile better to other people, so this is a way to do that.</description>

      <description>The blank page So many possibilities, but so much anxiety. How do I make this interesting? Who will even read this? Have I picked the best theme? What should my other posts be? How do I go forward from here? Is this for me, or for you?&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a poem about it as well if you thought I wasn&amp;rsquo;t dramatic enough Beating the blank page / Alan j Wright A Battle-Cry for the Brave Young Writer.</description>
