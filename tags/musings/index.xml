      <description>Every Quarter, I try to spend some time on professional self-reflection. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the journey of being aware of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, and getting better all the time.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to blog about it, instead of just putting it in a notebook. Why?
One of the things I want to do is communicate my professional profile better to other people, so this is a way to do that.</description>

Crowd interaction, controlling my voice, gesturing, joking with the audience now and then, answering questions; Honestly, I really like it.</description>

      <description>The blank page So many possibilities, but so much anxiety. How do I make this interesting? Who will even read this? Have I picked the best theme? What should my other posts be? How do I go forward from here? Is this for me, or for you?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a poem about it as well if you thought I wasn&amp;rsquo;t dramatic enough Beating the blank page / Alan j Wright A Battle-Cry for the Brave Young Writer.</description>
