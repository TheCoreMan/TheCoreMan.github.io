      <description>隻手声あり、その声を聞け? (Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?)

 Continuing on the journey of knowledge, I wanted to practice more Clojure. Last time we went over first sections of Learn Clojure: syntax and functions. The main way I learned was by doing the exercises at the bottom of each page. But for the rest of the subjects in the guide, there are no exercises!</description>

      <description>I started this post AFTER starting to work on a Clojure script, when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable enough with the language and tools to actually start working on the script. I needed to feel more comfortable before starting to work.
In this post I go over how to setup a basic Clojure development environment and I solve all the exercises from the &amp;ldquo;Learn Clojure&amp;rdquo; guide, with examples and explanations.</description>

      <description>Adding EmacsLips programs to extend Emacs&amp;rsquo;s functionality from source is something I&amp;rsquo;ve found non-obvious (had to open multiple tabs for). Today I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to figure it out, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually very simple, so here&amp;rsquo;s the guide:
A - Find the program you want to add In my case, it was &amp;ldquo;Transpose Frame&amp;rdquo; by irie.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled across it from this StackExchange answer.
 If the program is available on MELPA, you can just add it to the additional-packages list in your .</description>
