      <description>Met up with Aviv Sarig to practice some CSS. I found CSS Diner and we went through it to hone our CSS selection skills.&#xA;Start with &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;: why practice selectors? I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why we need selectors in the first place. The answer is simple - to select specific elements in the DOM so we can style them the way we want.&#xA;I think that building good semantic HTML is the first step to writing good CSS, and that knowing how I&amp;rsquo;ll end up selecting elements will impact how I structure the HTML itself.</description>

You can use it to study for a test or memorize notes from a book you&amp;rsquo;ve read. Cool! How do I get it for my Hugo site? Download these three files:&#xA;CSS JS HTML Shortcode And put them in the right places in your Hugo project. The JS and CSS files go in your static/js/flashcard.</description>

      <description>You might be asking yourself how did you get here? I know I&amp;rsquo;m sort of asking myself the same question: the TL;DR is I never stop learning, and right now I needed to learn some CSS for my job.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning CSS for real at work recently to be able to do full-stack E2E development. So far, CSS was a &amp;ldquo;hack it until it works&amp;rdquo; kind of thing for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it properly.</description>
