      <description>How did we get here Back when I left Reco, my parting gift to everyone at the company was books üìö. At the time, these were books I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, but were recommended by the interwebz.

That&amp;rsquo;s how I wrote a book report about &amp;ldquo;Turn the Ship Around&amp;rdquo;, for example.</description>

The post starts with the design, then moves to implementation of DB connectivity, then the data models themselves, and finally some testing.&#xA;Upfront, we had to decide if we&amp;rsquo;ll choose a relational database or something else - and we decided to go relational.</description>
