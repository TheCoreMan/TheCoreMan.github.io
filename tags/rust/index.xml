      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the rest of the devlogs, you can find them here. You might be missing some context if you don&amp;rsquo;t.
Also, this is an old blogpost about something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually released as part of the project yet. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll finish it but the documentation value is important.
After another successful workshop,
Another Git workshop in the books, as the game server monitoring graphs can attest ‚úÖ So fun when things work out well and people enjoy and learn.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúToday I have grown taller from walking with the trees.‚Äù
‚Äï Karle Wilson Baker
 Welcome back to my devlog series, where I discuss the development of make-git-better version 2 - a git CTF challenge. Last time we finished developing a script that automated generating the main git server hook for the CTF.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re automating another big part of the challenge: creating the level browser.
 Why do we need a level browser?</description>

      <description>Last time we talked a lot about the HOW. This post is about realizing some parts of that plan into a real working PoC.
It only took us three development logs to start writing code. So fast! /s
 The first step was doing it manually, once üë®üèΩ‚Äçüè≠‚öí  Writing a pre-receive hook Looking at the push contents during the pre-receive execution Manually performing all the actions to deploy a game server  Starting to automate ü§ñ  Generating the pre-receive hook automatically ü§ñ I guess I&amp;rsquo;m a Rustacean now ü¶Ä Requirements: What does the script need to do Implementation: Breaking the problem into smaller problems, and solving them one by one  Parsing game-config.</description>

      <description>Last time we talked a lot about the WHY. This post is all about the HOW.
 If a task is done and no one marks it in a ticketing system, does it actually work? Let&amp;rsquo;s do high-level requirements first  Here&amp;rsquo;s how a user will start playing the CTF Here&amp;rsquo;s the general idea for how a user plays a single level  HLD Planning the level database  What defines &amp;ldquo;Level&amp;rdquo; Given this definition of &amp;ldquo;Level&amp;rdquo;, what&amp;rsquo;s the structure of the DB Level DB folder structure  Envisioning the project structure Back on planet earth&amp;hellip; üåç Next time  If a task is done and no one marks it in a ticketing system, does it actually work?</description>
