      <description>&amp;ldquo;Shay, you mentioned some number of episodes ago that the army took your mouse for a while. What would you do if they took your keyboard, as well?&amp;rdquo;

How did we get here? On a recent Cup o&amp;rsquo; Go episode I interviewed Josh Bleecher Snyder, and he mentioned that he was using Cursorless to edit his code, since he was dealing with some wrist pain.</description>
