      <description>Everyone benefits from accessibility.
Accessible design improves access to information on the web for individuals with and without disabilities. Well-designed, accessible web sites expedite the delivery of information and services. Providing accessible websites and electronic documents allows a greater variety of consumers to obtain information regardless of their individual needs.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Shay, you mentioned some number of episodes ago that the army took your mouse for a while. What would you do if they took your keyboard, as well?&amp;rdquo;
This post is starting out by me typing it on my keyboard. However, if things go well, by the end of this post some part should be typed out with my voice.
Every part that is in between lines (like this one) is actually typed out with Cursorless and with my voice, not my keyboard.</description>
