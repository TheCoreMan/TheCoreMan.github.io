      <description>How did we get here Back when I left Reco, my parting gift to everyone at the company was books ðŸ“š. At the time, these were books I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, but were recommended by the interwebz. The idea was to stay in touch with the team by gifting them good books and loaning them from time to time. That&amp;rsquo;s how I wrote a book report about &amp;ldquo;Turn the Ship Around&amp;rdquo;, for example.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet following Anton Drukh&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.&#xA;This summary is mostly for me and for people I&amp;rsquo;ll refer it to - so it&amp;rsquo;s not the most friendly read. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the book, this post can serve as a useful TL;DR for you. I highly recommend you do read it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great read and a short one, too!</description>
