      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>
