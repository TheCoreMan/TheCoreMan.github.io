      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet following Anton Drukh&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.
This summary is mostly for me and for people I&amp;rsquo;ll refer it to - so it&amp;rsquo;s not the most friendly read. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the book, this post can serve as a useful TL;DR for you. I highly recommend you do read it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great read and a short one, too!</description>

      <title>How to Build Your Team to Increase Velocity</title>

      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>
