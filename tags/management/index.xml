      <description>As a manager, I felt the struggle of trying to balance the urgency of delivering new features with the importance of maintaining high code quality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I went together with a team lead from Reco - Michael Lantsman - to a great meetup at Riskified about this subject exactly. It had some great insights, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here :)
After some food and beer, Shai Peretz gave a warm introduction, then Itay Waxman shared some practical strategies for fast delivery without creating tech debt, and finally we had a very insightful panel about team velocity.</description>

      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding our R&amp;amp;D structure. Part of the change means that ownership of delivery is mostly on me: essentially updating my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), temporarily. I say temporarily since I&amp;rsquo;m sure that we&amp;rsquo;ll change again and again. The exciting part is that we&amp;rsquo;re building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster.</description>
