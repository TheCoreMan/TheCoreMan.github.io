      <description>News at Reco! Soon - exactly 1 next month from when I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post - I&amp;rsquo;m going to take ownership of all delivery in the company. This includes changing my title to VP R&amp;amp;D (from VP of Engineering), building a structure of 4 cross-functional teams, and growing the group members a lot faster. This is a big move for me, and I want it to succeed.
I wrote this document to help me (and my teams) visualize how will good teams look.</description>
