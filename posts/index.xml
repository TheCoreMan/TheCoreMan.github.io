      <description>I recently gave a talk in DefCon SAFEMODE Red Team Village. It was a very interesting and unique experience, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
The talk itself The talk was titled Making Breach &amp;amp; Attack Simulation Accessible and Actionable with Infection Monkey. Watch the recording here:
  Lectures, COVID, and crowd interaction Giving a live talk is something I very much enjoy doing. üé§
Crowd interaction, controlling my voice, gesturing, joking with the audience now and then, answering questions; Honestly, I really like it.</description>

‚Äï Karle Wilson Baker
 Welcome back to my devlog series, where I discuss the development of make-git-better version 2 - a git CTF challenge. Last time we finished developing a script that automated generating the main git server hook for the CTF.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re automating another big part of the challenge: creating the level browser.
 Why do we need a level browser?</description>

      <description>Recently, I had to fix some bugs in a Python AWS lambda which gets triggered by an API Gateway. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the way that Lambdas work makes you want to develop it badly. So I hope you can use these tips when you develop your Lambdas to do it better.
I worked on a Python Lambda, so this is what you&amp;rsquo;ll see in this post.
 How to test AWS Lambda + API Gateway successfully  Whitebox: Cover the logic in regular unit tests Blackbox: Cover the Gateway API Gateway API Stages Writing the tests Choose which tests you want to run using pytest&amp;rsquo;s -k switch  What now  How to test AWS Lambda + API Gateway successfully The main thing I found to be useful during the development process of AWS Lambdas that are triggered by a Gateway was testing them automatically, in two ways:</description>
